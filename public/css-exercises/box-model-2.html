     <h4 class="to-clear-left">Columnar Cactus</h4><img src="http://www.veeriku.tartu.ee/~ppensa/cactusbar.jpg" height="100"> The colors are beautiful, but the barrel cactus has an inner secret: if you are in need of hydration in the desert, this cactus has a lot of fluid inside and has saved the lives of many. Barrel cactus buds typically start to bloom in April with a bright yellow or orange flower. Pink and red varieties also exist but occur less frequently. The flowers only appear on the very top of the plant.
