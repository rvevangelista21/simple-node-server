    <p> <i>My Top Three Favorite Movie</i> </p>
    <p> My first Favorite Movie is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120794/"> Prince of Egypt</a> because of the fact that the story revolves on how Moses free his people with of course commanded by God himself. The feeling that his people were saved and free from slavery. I hope that it will happen also to us. Free from Imperialists, Bureaucartic Capitalist and Feudalists.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My second Favorite Movie is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/?ref_=nv_sr_1"> Titanic</a> because of course.. it is TITANIC. Who in the right mind haven't watched Titanic yet and didn't like it??</p>
<br>
<p>My third Favorite Movie is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107688/?ref_=nv_sr_1"> Nightmare before Christmas</a>. I grew up with this movie and it become my tradition to watch this movie during Halloween season. I just love the character of Jack Skelington and how he candidly sing in the movie.</p>

<p><i>My top Favorite Bands</i></p>
<p>My first Favorite Band is none other than <a href="https://www.facebook.com/decemberave"> December Avenue</a>! They are the coolest indie band that I know of so far. Their music is really amazing and what amazes me is that they are not still in the mainstream industry despite their cool songs with epic lyrics.</p>
<p>My second Favorite Band is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/urbandub?fref=ts">Ubandub</a>. I listen to them throughout my high school days and I bought every CDs that they have and have it signed. I was also lucky enough to watch them here in LB before they decided to disband.</p>
<p> My third Favorite Band is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/parokyaniedgarofficial?fref=ts"> Parokya Ni Edgar</a>. Who doesn't love them right? Every 90s kid practically grew up listening to them. It seems pretty simple. You just got to love them.</p>
